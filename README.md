# Game Settings

This repository exists to preserve config files for games that meet the following criteria

* Games that require a lot of fine tuning for graphics and controls
* Games that sometimes modify config files programmatically in unpredictable ways
* Games that do not store config files in the cloud

The scripts used in this repo have filepaths specific to my personal game installation locations. They will not reflect yours in all likelihood.

This repo is public so that I can easily share settings files with friends and acquaintances getting into the games I play.
