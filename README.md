# Game Settings

This repository exists to preserve config files for games that meet the following criteria

* Games that require a lot of fine tuning for graphics and controls
* Games that sometimes modify config files programmatically in unpredictable ways
* Games that do not store config files in the cloud

This repo is public so that I can easily share settings files with friends and acquaintances getting into the games I play.
